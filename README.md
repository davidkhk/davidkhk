# Hi there! :wave:

At [Uncover](https://www.uncover.co), I specialize in frontend development leveraging functional programming languages like Elm to build intuitive and user-centric UIs. My primary focus is building features that empower clients dive into complex data with ease, creating interactive graphs and charts that transform insights into action. My role also involves database design and optimization with Elixir (Ecto) and SQL, ensuring our backend seamlessly supports our frontend solutions.
