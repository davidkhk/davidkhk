# Hi there! :wave:

I'm a self-taught Elixir software developer with experience building, shipping and maintaining projects. Solid background in successfully working autonomously with minimal supervision taking ownership of my work. Constantly driven to expand my knowledge, both in my professional pursuits and personal interests. I'm currently an Elixir backend developer at [Uncover](https://www.uncover.co).
