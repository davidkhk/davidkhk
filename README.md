# Hi there! :wave:

At [Uncover](https://www.uncover.co), my role as a software engineer involves the development and maintenance of platform features, with a strong focus on Postgres database design and optimization using Ecto and SQL, building secure GraphQL APIs using Absinthe, and also UX building performant and reusable components using Elm.

I enjoy solving complex problems with simple and straightforward solutions. Whether it's optimizing code efficiency or streamlining user experiences, I believe in creativity and simplicity to drive meaningful outcomes.
